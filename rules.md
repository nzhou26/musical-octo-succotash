# X-Team 89 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks


Choose which task you think you would be able to do the best or want to learn how to do.



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will have weekly updates and when you have finished a task you tell everyone and see what else needs to be done.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will ask other group members for help first before asking someone else to switch tasks or do the task.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Continuously check in to see if jobs that need to be completed have been completed.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Always communicate any confusion in communication.
